Download the "formValidation.zip" file attached to this assignment. You will NOT be editing the HTML or CSS, ONLY the JavaScript.

Change the title of the h2 tag to CONTACT ME (or anything else you deem professional in nature and matching your chosen Theme).
Hint: "<h2><strong>Contact</strong> Us</h2>" is the HTML containing the current heading.
Change the background Image
Hint: Currently this is the CSS rule that places a specific image on the background:  "body #222222 url('images/txture.png') repeat top left;"`
Change the first paragraph to match your theme. Replace the <p> tag's content without adding a CLASS or ID to the tag itself. No Lorem Ipsum, use real content!
Update the “placeholder” attributes to match your theme.
Hint: First name, Last name, Phone Number, Address, Password, Number of cupcakes? etc.
Disable the submit button:
The CSS is already created .disabled
lines 86 - 110 in the stylesheet.
Make sure it's only enabled if all the validation checks are approved.
Create validation errors for every single input.
Validation must display an error message on the inputs if not filled in.
Create a Thank you screen:
Replace the form content if all only if validation passes
Images, content, and anything you add to complete the project must be related to an overall theme.
Write valid ES6 syntax- no frameworks.
You must show at least five (5) commits.
Record a roughly 3 to 5 minute video demonstrating your work. Include a description of your approach, a challenge you overcame, and a question that you still do not have an answer for or need more clarification. Upload this to your YouTube account.
